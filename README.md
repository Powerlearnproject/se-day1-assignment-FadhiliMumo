# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the designing, development and maintenance of a software. It is important in the technology industry since it creates business opportunities and offer technological growth.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The rise of programming languages- many programming languages have been developed due to the growth and demand for technology.
The rise of structured programming due to the evolving algorithms, methods, structures and flowchats
The growth in tools for software development



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- where the whole process begins 
Problem defination- where ideas are generated as a solution to the problems defined
software designing- designing hoe the software will appear and function according to the users needs
development process-the beginning of creating the actual software/prototype
testing- checking the developed software for any bugs
deployment and maintenance- launching/ releasing the software to the intended users and maintaining /updating the software 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In Agile methodology software development and testing is done in an iterative manner focusing on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
In waterfall methodology software development follows sequential steps from the problem definition to the maintainace and deployment stages.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-responsible for writing code and offering software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager-Is for the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects from the start of planning to the point of deployment




Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The IDESs and the version Control Systems significantly enhance developer productivity by providing a centralized platform for writing, debugging, and managing code changes, allowing for efficient collaboration and error tracking within a team. Git and NetBeans IDE.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Security of user data, communication issues with clients or passive users of a system, technical issues.
Problem breakdown, use of language translators.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves focusing on individual units of code
Integration testing involves testing on how code modules work together
System testing test the  entire system as whole
acceptance testing involves testing if the system meets the requirements of the users before deployment


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is the traffic
What is the traffic on Mombasa road 
It defines the specific road on the traffic prompt focus
